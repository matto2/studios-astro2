          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matthew&mdash;I'm a lifelong artist, born in San Francisco
          and raised in Santa Cruz. I usually paint with acrylics on board or
          canvas. Surfing and the coast have been favorite subjects of my art
          ever since I was young. I draw inspiration from trips to Northern
          California, Big Sur, Hawaii, and beyond. Great art, excellent design,
          and web publishing are all passions of mine. I co-founded The Juice, a
          regional surfing magazine, and have designed a few book covers.
          Currently, I work as a Freelance Web & Graphic Designer. I can often
          be found in <s>Santa Cruz</s> Monterey surfing or hiking/biking around
          town, up the coast, or in the mountains. Here's me
